# Student Information System - Student App

## Description

Welcome to DEVHIVE's Student Information System web app! Our web app aims to change the current physical paper filling system into an automated web system, facilitating collaboration between students, lecturers, and the AR office at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Jaffna. The app provides an easy, efficient, and automated experience for managing student information and academic processes.
